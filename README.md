### Welcome to the Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide Project

The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set
of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist
format, that can be integrated into the development life-cycle.

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather then on vulnerabilities and
exploits. It includes an introduction to Software Security Principles and a
glossary of key terms.

It is designed to serve as a secure coding kick-start tool and easy reference,
to help development teams quickly understand secure coding practices.

### Sections of the Guide

* Table of contents
