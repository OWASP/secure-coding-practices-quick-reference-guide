# Security Policy

## Reporting malware

This project is built on markdown which is used to create various binary files such as `.pdf`.
It is improbable but not impossible that a malicious actor could somehow embed malware in the markdown or subvert the document creation process. 

If you find anything suspicious in either the markdown or pipeline scripts then let us know ASAP and we will fix it as a priority.
For secure disclosure send an encrypted email to [Jon Gadsden](https://flowcrypt.com/me/jongadsden).
