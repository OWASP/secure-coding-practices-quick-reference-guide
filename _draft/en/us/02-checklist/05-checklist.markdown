# Secure Coding Practices Checklist {#secure-coding-practices-checklist .list-paragraph}

## Input Validation {#input-validation .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Conduct all input validation on a trusted system (server side not client side)

- [ ]   Identify all data sources and classify them into trusted and untrusted.

- [ ]   Validate all data from untrusted sources (databases, file streams, etc.)

- [ ]   Use a centralized input validation routine for the whole application

- [ ]   Specify character sets, such as UTF-8, for all input sources

- [ ]   Encode input to a common character set before validating

- [ ]   All validation failures should result in input rejection

- [ ]   If the system supports UTF-8 extended character sets and validate after UTF-8 decoding is completed

- [ ]   Validate all client provided data before processing

- [ ]   Verify that protocol header values in both requests and responses contain only ASCII characters

- [ ]   Validate data from redirects

- [ ]   Validate for expected data types using an \"allow\" list rather than a \"deny\" list

- [ ]   Validate data range

- [ ]   Validate data length

- [ ]   If any potentially input must be allowed as input then implement additional controls

- [ ]   If the standard validation routine cannot address some inputs then use discrete checks

- [ ]   Utilize canonicalization to address obfuscation attacks

## Output Encoding {#output-encoding .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Conduct all output encoding on a trusted system (server side not client side)

- [ ]   Utilize a standard, tested routine for each type of outbound encoding

- [ ]   Specify character sets, such as UTF-8, for all outputs

- [ ]   Contextually output encode all data returned to the client from untrusted sources

- [ ]   Ensure the output encoding is safe for all target systems

- [ ]   Contextually sanitize all output of un-trusted data to queries for SQL, XML, and LDAP

- [ ]   Sanitize all output of untrusted data to operating system commands

## Authentication and Password Management {#authentication-and-password-management .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Require authentication for all pages and resources, except those
    specifically intended to be public

- [ ]   All authentication controls must be enforced on a trusted system

- [ ]   Establish and utilize standard, tested, authentication services whenever possible

- [ ]   Use a centralized implementation for all authentication controls,
    including libraries that call external authentication services

- [ ]   Segregate authentication logic from the resource being requested and
    use redirection to and from the centralized authentication control

- [ ]   All authentication controls should fail securely

- [ ]   All administrative and account management functions must be at least
    as secure as the primary authentication mechanism

- [ ]   If your application manages a credential store, use cryptographically strong one-way salted hashes

- [ ]   Password hashing must be implemented on a trusted system server side not client side)

- [ ]   Validate the authentication data only on completion of all data input

- [ ]   Authentication failure responses should not indicate which part of the authentication data was incorrect

- [ ]   Utilize authentication for connections to external systems that involve sensitive information or functions

- [ ]   Authentication credentials for accessing services external to the
    application should be stored in a secure store

- [ ]   Use only HTTP POST requests to transmit authentication credentials

- [ ]   Only send non-temporary passwords over an encrypted connection or as encrypted data

- [ ]   Enforce password complexity requirements established by policy or regulation

- [ ]   Enforce password length requirements established by policy or regulation

- [ ]   Password entry should be obscured on the user\'s screen

- [ ]   Enforce account disabling after an established number of invalid login attempts

- [ ]   Password reset and changing operations require the same level of
    controls as account creation and authentication

- [ ]   Password reset questions should support sufficiently random answers

- [ ]   If using email based resets, only send email to a pre-registered
    address with a temporary link/password

- [ ]   Temporary passwords and links should have a short expiration time

- [ ]   Enforce the changing of temporary passwords on the next use

- [ ]   Notify users when a password reset occurs

- [ ]   Prevent password re-use

- [ ]   Passwords should be at least one day old before they can be changed,
    to prevent attacks on password re-use

- [ ]   Enforce password changes based on requirements established in policy
    or regulation, with the time between resets administratively controlled

- [ ]   Disable \"remember me\" functionality for password fields

- [ ]   The last use (successful or unsuccessful) of a user account should
    be reported to the user at their next successful login

- [ ]   Implement monitoring to identify attacks against multiple user accounts, utilizing the same password

- [ ]   Change all vendor-supplied default passwords and user IDs or disable the associated accounts

- [ ]   Re-authenticate users prior to performing critical operations

- [ ]   Use Multi-Factor Authentication for highly sensitive or high value transactional accounts

- [ ]   If using third party code for authentication, inspect the code
    carefully to ensure it is not affected by any malicious code

## Session Management {#session-management .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Use the server or framework's session management controls. The
    application should recognize only these session identifiers as
    valid

- [ ]   Session identifier creation must always be done on a trusted system (server side not client side)

- [ ]   Session management controls should use well vetted algorithms that
    ensure sufficiently random session identifiers

- [ ]   Set the domain and path for cookies containing authenticated session
    identifiers to an appropriately restricted value for the site

- [ ]   Logout functionality should fully terminate the associated session or connection

- [ ]   Logout functionality should be available from all pages protected by authorization

- [ ]   Establish a session inactivity timeout that is as short as possible,
    based on balancing risk and business functional requirements

- [ ]   Disallow persistent logins and enforce periodic session
    terminations, even when the session is active

- [ ]   If a session was established before login, close that session and
    establish a new session after a successful login

- [ ]   Generate a new session identifier on any re-authentication

- [ ]   Do not allow concurrent logins with the same user ID

- [ ]   Do not expose session identifiers in URLs, error messages or logs

- [ ]   Implement appropriate access controls to protect server side session data
    from unauthorized access from other users of the server

- [ ]   Generate a new session identifier and deactivate the old one periodically

- [ ]   Generate a new session identifier if the connection security changes
    from HTTP to HTTPS, as can occur during authentication
    
- [ ]   Consistently utilize HTTPS rather than switching between HTTP to HTTPS

- [ ]   Supplement standard session management for sensitive server-side
    operations, like account management, by utilizing per-session
    strong random tokens or parameters

- [ ]   Supplement standard session management for highly sensitive or
    critical operations by utilizing per-request, as opposed to
    per-session, strong random tokens or parameters

- [ ]   Set the \"secure\" attribute for cookies transmitted over an TLS connection

- [ ]   Set cookies with the HttpOnly attribute, unless you specifically
    require client-side scripts within your application to read or set
    a cookie\'s value

## Access Control {#access-control .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Use only trusted system objects, e.g. server side session objects,
    for making access authorization decisions

- [ ]   Use a single site-wide component to check access authorization. This
    includes libraries that call external authorization services

- [ ]   Access controls should fail securely

- [ ]   Deny all access if the application cannot access its security
    configuration information

- [ ]   Enforce authorization controls on every request, including those made by server side scripts

- [ ]   Segregate privileged logic from other application code

- [ ]   Restrict access to files or other resources, including those outside
    the application\'s direct control, to only authorized users

- [ ]   Restrict access to protected URLs to only authorized users

- [ ]   Restrict access to application data to only authorized users

- [ ]   Restrict access to user and data attributes and policy information used by access controls

- [ ]   Restrict access security-relevant configuration information to only authorized users

- [ ]   Server side implementation and presentation layer representations of access control rules must match

- [ ]   If state data must be stored on the client, use encryption and integrity checking on the server side
    to detect state tampering

- [ ]   Enforce application logic flows to comply with business rules

- [ ]   Limit the number of transactions a single user or device can perform
    in a given period of time. The transactions/time should be above
    the actual business requirement, but low enough to deter automated
    attacks

- [ ]   Use the \"referer\" header as a supplemental check only, it should
    never be the sole authorization check, as it is can be spoofed

- [ ]   If long authenticated sessions are allowed, periodically re-validate
    a user's authorization to ensure that their privileges have not
    changed and if they have, log the user out and force them to
    re-authenticate

- [ ]   Implement account auditing and enforce the disabling of unused accounts

- [ ]   The application must support disabling of accounts
    and terminating sessions when authorization ceases

- [ ]   Service accounts or accounts supporting connections to or from
    external systems should have the least privilege possible

- [ ]   Create an Access Control Policy to document an application\'s
    business rules, data types and access authorization criteria
    and/or processes so that access can be properly provisioned and
    controlled. This includes identifying access requirements for both
    the data and system resources

## Cryptographic Practices {#cryptographic-practices .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   All cryptographic functions used to protect secrets from the
    application user must be implemented on a trusted system

- [ ]   Protect master secrets from unauthorized access

    FIPS 140-2 or an equivalent standard

- [ ]   Establish and utilize a policy and process for how cryptographic
    keys will be managed

    data and system information that is required to perform their
    tasks

- [ ]   Protect all cached or temporary copies of sensitive data stored on
    the server from unauthorized access and purge those temporary
    working files a soon as they are no longer required.

    verification data, even on the server side. Always use well vetted
    algorithms, see \"Cryptographic Practices\" for additional
    guidance

- [ ]   Protect server-side source-code from being downloaded by a user

- [ ]   Do not store passwords, connection strings or other sensitive
    information in clear text or in any non-cryptographically secure

    the server. This includes cached data, temporary files and data
    that should be accessible only by specific system users

## Communication Security {#communication-security .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Implement encryption for the transmission of all sensitive
    information. This should include TLS for protecting the connection
    and may be supplemented by discrete encryption of sensitive files
    or non-HTTP based connections

- [ ]   TLS certificates should be valid and have the correct domain name,
    not be expired, and be installed with intermediate certificates
    when required

- [ ]   Failed TLS connections should not fall back to an insecure connection

- [ ]   Utilize TLS connections for all content requiring authenticated access and for all other sensitive information

    changes to the code both in development and production

## Database Security {#database-security .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Use strongly typed parameterized queries

- [ ]   Utilize input validation and output encoding and be sure to address
    meta characters. If these fail, do not run the database command

- [ ]   Ensure that variables are strongly typed

- [ ]   The application should use the lowest possible level of privilege
    when accessing the database

- [ ]   Use secure credentials for database access

- [ ]   Connection strings should not be hard coded within the application.
    Connection strings should be stored in a separate configuration
    file on a trusted system and they should be encrypted.

- [ ]   Use stored procedures to abstract data access and allow for the
    removal of permissions to the base tables in the database

- [ ]   Close the connection as soon as possible

- [ ]   Remove or change all default database administrative passwords

- [ ]   Turn off all unnecessary database functionality

- [ ]   Remove unnecessary default vendor content (for example sample schemas)

- [ ]   Disable any default accounts that are not required to support business requirements

- [ ]   The application should connect to the database with different
    credentials for every trust distinction (e.g., user, read-only
    user, guest, administrators)

## File Management {#file-management .list-paragraph}

- [ ]   Do not pass user supplied data directly to any dynamic include function

- [ ]   Require authentication before allowing a file to be uploaded

    directory as a logical drive using the associated path or the
    chrooted environment

- [ ]   When referencing existing files, use an allow-list of allowed file names and types

    tasks. Do not allow the application to issue commands directly to
    the Operating System, especially through the use of application
    initiated command shells

- [ ]   Use checksums or hashes to verify the integrity of interpreted code,
    libraries, executables, and configuration files

- [ ]   Utilize locking to prevent multiple simultaneous requests or use a
    synchronization mechanism to prevent race conditions

- [ ]   Protect shared variables and resources from inappropriate concurrent
    access

- [ ]   Explicitly initialize all your variables and other data stores,
    either during declaration or just before the first usage
